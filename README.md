# Rustat

Generate statistic charts about the Bitcoin blockchain.

# TODO

move to svg created from rust, remove javascript
OK move to 1000 blocks as labels (with date between parenthesis) so period more rightly compared
merge periods until there are less than N points on the chart. N=100? more? Latest point could be estimated by duplicating latest complete value?
